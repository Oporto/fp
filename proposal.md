## Description

Our project is mainly based around the three js framework and the idea that users can see their favorite music visualized in different ways through the tool. They can also share the music and visualization combination with their friends in a social media like setting. We will explore the Spotify and Facebook APIs, but also consider other options. In the social media, one possible feature is the feed where shared songs and visualizations can be seen. Another possibility, if the framework allows, is that songs are "contrasted" or "added" to each other when playlists are made or when users directly decide to do so. We plan to make the visualization options flexible and diverse for the user.

We will manage user information in MongoDB, as well as the existing posts/messages/etc. We will use express in node js and possibly a passport that uses a facebook and/or spotify strategy. We will use the three js framework and a css framework like bulma as necessary. Lastly, we will likely explore the use of REACT due to the fact that we will be building a feed with repeated DOM elements.
